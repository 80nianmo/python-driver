0.15 Upgrade to use Datastax Native Driver

Calls to execute should no longer use named placeholders.
We no longer raise cqlengine based OperationalError when connection fails.  Now using the exception thrown in the native driver.

If you're calling setup() with the old thrift port in place, you will get connection errors.  Either remove it (the default native port is assumed) or change to the default native port, 9042.
