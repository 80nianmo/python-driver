0.15 Upgrade to use Datastax Native Driver

We no longer raise cqlengine based OperationalError when connection fails.  Now using the exception thrown in the native driver.

If you're calling setup() with the old thrift port in place, you will get connection errors.  Either remove it (the default native port is assumed) or change to the default native port, 9042.

The cqlengine connection pool has been removed.  Connections are now managed by the native driver.  This should drastically reduce the socket overhead as the native driver can multiplex queries.

If you were previously manually using "ALL", "QUORUM", etc, to specificy consistency levels, you will need to migrate to the cqlengine.ALL, QUORUM, etc instead.  If you had been using the module level constants before, nothing should need to change.
